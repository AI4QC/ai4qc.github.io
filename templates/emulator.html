    <p class="h4" > <b>🔬 TransOrb: A Unified Orbital-Based Learning Framework </b> </p>
    <p> TransOrb is proposed to a next-generation framework that unifies molecular orbital (MO)- & atomic orbital (AO)-based learning to enable accurate, scalable, and transferable predictions of electronic structure properties across diverse chemical systems. Building on our earlier works—MOB-ML (targeting high-accuracy with small data) & OrbNet (targeting large-scale systems with DFT-level accuracy)—TransOrb integrates the strengths of both methods to span the entire landscape of quantum chemical modeling . Also, this framework leverages MO and/or AO features represented by information post-processed/transformed from energy matrices obtained from various SCF procedure with different costs. E.g., more expensive SCF procedure (e.g., Hartree–Fock) and/or efficient semi-empirical methods (e.g., GFN2-xTB). <b>This general representation and framework can bridge different levels of theory and different sizes of data availability via various learning protocols & downstream tasks at both ground & excited states.</b></p> 
    <p class="h5"><b>Some possible learning modes including: </b></p>
<ul>
    <p><li> 🧬 <b>General representation of chemical systems via contrastive representation learning</b></li></p>
    <p><li> 📈 <b>Efficient & uncertainty-aware wavefunction-related property prediction by supervised learning (regression), using deep kernel learning from limited <a href="simulator.html">Simulator</a> data</b></li></p>
